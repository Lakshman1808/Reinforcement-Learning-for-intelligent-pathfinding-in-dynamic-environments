# Reinforcement-learning-for-intelligent-pathfinding-in-dynamic-environments
• Developed an RL-based model for robotic path planning in dynamic, partially unknown environments. • Implemented DQNs and Q-learning on a grid structure for adaptive navigation. • Balanced risk reduction and travel eﬃciency for optimized pathﬁnding. • Applicable to robotics, self-driving vehicles, and intelligent traﬃc management.
